[Play it here!](https://colleencleary.github.io/ghost-neutralizer/)

### In-browser game made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
At its core, the game is a point and click shooter game that uses the cursor to hit attacking ghost. CSS animations provide an extra challenge, and transparent background objects allow for the development of a storyline (as awful as it may be)

Due to the story-progressing objects, this version of the game is not mobile friendly (yet!)

### Unsolved Problems
  * storyline needs further development (especially the ending-it's a bit lackluster)
  * final pop-up won't show
  * health bars won't align left (they are center aligned despite being styled otherwise)
  * weird problem with the appended button not working on the final level. had to make new buttons each time one was needed.
